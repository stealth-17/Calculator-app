<h1>Help!</h1>
<h2>1. Calculation</h2>
<b2><h1>Basic Calculator</h1>
For calculation simply type your expression as you do in normal calculator and hit the sum button.
The preveious answer is available at "Ans" you will be able to handle "Ans" as a normal memory element.
You can save both result and expression in memory usinmg "Mem" option in basix calculator. If the content is saved
a sign "M" appears at top. You can retrive the content of memory anytime by pressing "MS" button.<br />
<h2>Scientific Calculator</h2>
You can handle the scientific calculator as your normal scientific calculator. You can calculate trignometic values in both
degree format and in radian format. By default it is in degree format. You can change this option by pressing "DRG" button.
Please be careful if you got mistakes in your expression answer will be error.</b2>
<h3>2. Graph Plotting</h3>
<b3>Graph plotting is implemented as an experimental part. So there is a chance of error. But still you will be able to
plot some basic graphs. This option is implemente using androidplot a free java package distributed under GPL license. Learn more
about androidplot at "http://androidplot.com/". Use "var x" key to insert a variable x in your expression. Type your complete expression and goto options then
click on Plot menu which is available only in scientific mode. Please be aware that this portion is experimental so I'm not assuring accurate result. But still I believe not a chance for that much error :-).
