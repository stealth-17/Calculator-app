For calculation simply type your expression as you do in normal calculator and hit the sum button.
The preveious answer is available at "Ans" you will be able to handle "Ans" as a normal memory element.
You can save both result and expression in memory usinmg "Mem" option in basix calculator. If the content is saved
a sign "M" appears at top. You can retrive the content of memory anytime by pressing "MS" button.<br />

Please be careful if you got mistakes in your expression answer will be error. Because of this app is still under development
we are not completely rectified all its problems yet. So if yiu got any bug or error please inform us so that we can fix it

<h3>2. Graph Plotting</h3>
<b3>Graph plotting is implemented as an experimental part. So there is a chance of error. But still you will be able to
plot some basic graphs. This option is implemente using androidplot a free java package distributed under GPL license. Learn more
about androidplot at http://androidplot.com/..... Use "var x" key to insert a variable x in your expression. Type your complete expression and hit options then
click on Plot menu which is available only in scientific mode. Please be aware that this portion is experimental so there is a chance of error.
We are not liable for any error causing due to this feature. But if you will inform us, we will definitely fix the problem in next version.
NB: Sooner we will be implementing better graph plotting and 3d graphview with the help of arity arithmatic engine.</b3>
